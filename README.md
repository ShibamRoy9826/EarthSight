</h2>
Pollution To Power is an innovative web application built on Python's Django framework, designed to empower individuals in their efforts to monitor and reduce carbon emissions.
This platform allows users to track their yearly carbon emissions, providing personalized suggestions to help reduce their carbon footprints. With detailed report, users can understand their impact and track their progress over time. Additionally, the locality report feature enables users to monitor the Air Quality Index (AQI) and levels of major pollutants in their area, providing real-time data and personalized suggestions to mitigate pollution effects and improve local air quality. By combining individual carbon tracking with local air quality monitoring, Pollution To Power encourages users to take proactive steps toward a more sustainable future.

<b>Some Insights</b>
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Most of the countries use Oil for their electricity production, which usually exerts about 730g of Carbon per 1KWh, which is a bad news!</li>
<li>On an average electricity costs about $0.16 globally.</li>
<li>Globally, on an average each person emmits about 4.61 tonnes of carbon each year, while the target emmissions are less than or equal to 2.5 tonnes!</li>
<li>Carbon Dioxide mostly from gas is around 1.3 tonnes per year per person!</li>
</ul>

This project is a lot inspired from a previous project that I worked on with a team ( <a href="https://github.com/ShibamRoy9826/EcoSight-Geek-a-thon-project">EcoSight</a> ) , this is basically a complete recreation with a better UI, and added feature like the Locality report, and i also removed some features which wouldn't be too helpful to the general people.This project is more oriented to target general public so that they can monitor their environment and save it!
